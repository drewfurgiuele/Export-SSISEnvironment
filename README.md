# Export-SSISEnvironment

Copying SSIS environments from one project folder to another on the same server can be tough enough, but what about copying from an entirely different server to another?

This script will take a given SSIS environment from within a given project folder and copy it to either the same server or a remote server. Simple as that.

Please note that this script requires the SQLPS module. Also, the script was written inside Visual Studio so if you just want the script and not the entire solution, just dig into the folders.

As always, don't just run things in production without testing first.

Did you like this script? Me too! Drop me a line at @pittfurg on twitter.
